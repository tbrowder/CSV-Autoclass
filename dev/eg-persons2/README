This repo started as a copy of the CSV database 
repo from the GBUMC Directory Project.

The following steps were then taken to strip
it of all personal data:

1. The .git directory was deleted, thus ensuring
no hidden data were available.

2. The .gitignore file was inspected to ensure no
personal data were available.

3. All pictures were deleted.

4. All .csv files were inspected and data lines 
removed except for some publicly available GBUMC
staff data.

5. All .dat files were inspected and data lines
with personal data removed except for some 
publicly available GBUMC staff data.

6. Finally, I moved the entire file tree
to the public repo CSV-Autoclass as
a subtree under /dev for reference as

    dev/eg-persons2
